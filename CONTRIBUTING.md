# Contributing to Quantract AI

We are delighted that you are interested in contributing to our Open Source project! We especially appreciate contributions during Hacktoberfest 2025.

## Contribution Guidelines

### 1. Choosing an Issue
* We encourage you to look at Issues labeled with **'hacktoberfest'** and **'good first issue'** if you are new to the project.
* **Crucially, ask to be assigned!** Post a comment asking a maintainer to assign the issue to you to avoid duplicate work.

### 2. The Development Workflow
1.  **Fork** the main Quantract-AI repository.
2.  **Clone** your forked repository to your local machine.
3.  **Create a New Branch.** Use descriptive branch names based on the type of change and the Issue number:
    * **Features:** `feat/issue-number-short-name` (e.g., `feat/3259-linear-regression-tool`)
    * **Fixes:** `fix/issue-number-bug-fix-name`
    * **Command:** `git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name`
4.  Make your changes and write clear, concise commit messages.

### 3. Submitting a Pull Request (PR)
* Ensure your code passes all local tests before submitting.
* **PR Title:** Should be clear and brief. (e.g., `Feat: Added responsive image sidebar component`)
* **PR Description (Mandatory):**
    * Link the PR to the Issue it solves: **`Closes #<Issue Number>`**
    * Clearly describe the changes you made and why they are necessary.

### 4. Review and Acceptance (For Hacktoberfest)
* Maintainers will review your PR promptly. If changes are requested, please address them by pushing new commits to your existing branch.
* Your PR will be counted for Hacktoberfest if it is **Merged** OR if a maintainer adds the **`hacktoberfest-accepted`** label.
* We reserve the right to close PRs that are low-effort, trivial, or spam by labeling them **`spam`** or **`invalid`**.

**Thank you for helping us build Quantract AI!**
